# HAI-CRE-Demo2

This repository contains a realistic legacy .NET console application simulating a **Launch Scheduling System** for **Space Florida**. It was created to demonstrate how the **HAI Holistic Analyzer** can assess and document legacy codebases, identify modernization opportunities, and generate structured insights.

---
## Purpose

The application mimics a scheduling system that connects to a SQL Server database (`SpaceFloridaDB`) and retrieves upcoming launch data. It reflects common legacy patterns such as:

- Hardcoded connection strings
- Flat or semi-structured architecture
- Minimal modularization
